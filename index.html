	<h1> <center> Hi, My name is Jack Carlisle Ulbrich-Baker </center> </h1>

	<p> I am an engineering student in my 5th year, studying a double degree in both robotics engineering and behavioural economics.  I have a focus on Machine Learning and Robotics and have some example work in my portfolio shown above!  Thank you for looking at my website and if you would like to get into contact then please don't hesitate as my information and contact details are above.
	<a href="https://github.com/JackUlbrichBaker" target="_blank">This is a link to my GitHub</a>
<br> <br>
	I am currently part of an amazing student team called <a href="https://www.novarover.space/" target="_blank">Monash Nova Rover</a>.  The team is split into various sub teams that handle different parts of the rover with differing engineering disciplines being required.  I am a part of the Electrical subteam which handles all the hardware for power delivery, communications and computing on the rover.  In this team I have worked with CAN bus, SPI, I2C and SMD soldering and PCB assembly.  I have designed various carrier boards for the many systems, hot swappable voltage regulators, C++ embedded code interacting with CAN messages and more.
	<br> <br>
	In my spare time I will typically split my time between working on personal projects, playing guitar, powerlifting, hiking or rock climbing.  I have a passion for music as well as engineering and have performed many times, as well as playing in a few bands (you may have seen me at Nova Rover events).
